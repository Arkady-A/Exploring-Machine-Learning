# Exploring Machine Learning
Machine learning algorithms implementation in python with references, and with sketchy explanations. 

By opening ipynb files in corresponding directories you should see a notebook with explaining how the algorithm works.
### Currenlty explored algorithms:  
* [Linear regression](../master/Classification/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
* [Linear classification](../master/Regression/Linear%20Regressions.ipynb)
* [Principal Component Analysis](../master/Dimensionality%20Reduction/Principal%20Component%20Analysis%20\%28PCA%29/Principal%20Component%20Analysis.ipynb)

### Next algorithms: 
* Decision trees (classification and regression)
* Support Vector Machine

### In plans:
* Gradient boosted decision trees
* k-means
* Naive bayes
* Gradient Boosted Decision Trees
* Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Learning Vector Quantization
* Back propagation neural network

### In considerations:
* Deep learning algorithms
