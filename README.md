# Machine Learning
Machine learning algorithms implementation in python with references, and with sketchy explanations. 

By opening ipynb files you should see a notebook that will explain you how an algorithm of you choose work.
###Currenlty explored algorithms: 
* [Linear regression](/Classification/Logistic\ Regression.ipynb)
* [Linear classification](/MachineLearning/Regression/Linear\ Regressions.ipynb)
* [Principal Component Analysis](/Dimensionality\ Reduction/Principal\ Component\ Analysis\ \(PCA\)/Principal\ Component\ Analysis.ipynb)

###Next algorithms: 
* Decision trees (classification and regression)
* Support Vector Machine

###In plans:
* Gradient boosted decision trees
* k-means
* Naive bayes
* Gradient Boosted Decision Trees
* Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Learning Vector Quantization
* Back propagation neural network

###In considerations:
* Deep learning algorithms
